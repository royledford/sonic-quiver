## Sonic Quiver webpage

A redesign for the production music company Sonic Quiver.

Sonic Quiver was looking for a more modern design and up to date version of their website. The site is primarliy used
for marketing and a showcase of placements and their Youtube channel. Their music delivery is handled by their agents
and the Harvest Music Music App.

I was responsible for the design and development of the new site.

## Technologies

The website was built using React and bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

No CSS libraries were used and all styling was built from the ground up.

[Axiso](https://github.com/axios/axios) is used for Api calls to the Youtube Api to load the latest videos from their
feed.
